    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
        <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about
            an hour now.  On her desk, lying between the copies of
            <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i> and all
            the other scientific journals her work had
            appeared in, was a thumbed copy
            <cite>On The Road</cite>.  It had been Molly's
            favorite book since college, and the longer she spent
            in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be
            free.
        </p>
        <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,
            sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
            proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people
            who have nothing better to do.</q>Although many
            considered her pioneering work, unravelling the
            secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> to be an outstanding achievement. Molly
            <em>did</em> she think had something better to do.

    <h1>LIST EXAMPLE-Scrambled Eggs</h1>
        <p>Eggs are one of my favorite foods.  Here is a
            recipe for deliciously rich scrambled eggs.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tbs butter</li>
            <li>2 tbs cream</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a frying pan over a medium heat.</li>
            <li>Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Once butter has melted add cream and eggs.</li>
            <li>Using a spatula, fold the eggs from the edge of
            the pan to the center every 20 seconds (as if
                you are making an omelette).</li>
            <li>When the eggs are still moist remove from the
                heat (it will continue to cook on the plate
                until served).</li>
        </ol>
