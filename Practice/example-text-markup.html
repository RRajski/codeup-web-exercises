    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
        <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about
            an hour now.  On her desk, lying between the copies of
            <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i> and all
            the other scientific journals her work had
            appeared in, was a thumbed copy
            <cite>On The Road</cite>.  It had been Molly's
            favorite book since college, and the longer she spent
            in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be
            free.
        </p>
        <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,
            sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
            proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people
            who have nothing better to do</q>.Although many
            considered her pioneering work, unravelling the
            secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA></abbr> to be an outstanding achievement. Molly
            <em>did</em> she think had something better to do.

            <li>Once butter has melted add cream and eggs.</li>
            <li>Using a spatula fold the eggs from the edge of
            the panto the center every 20 seconds (as if
                you are making an omelette).</li>
            <li>When the eggs are still moist remove from the
                heat (it will continue to cook on the plate
